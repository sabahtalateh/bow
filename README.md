# Reset Syntax Highlighting

Light Modern builtin theme with reset syntax highlight

Theme used mainly for manual syntax highlight customization from scratch

- Theme settings dumped from default `Light Modern` theme with `Developer: Generate Color Theme from Current Settings`
- Then stored in `themes/theme.json`
- Then all the syntax highlight removed
